# Ethereum-Playground

The Ethereum Playground allows users to interact with the Ethereum network in their browser.  Users can send compliant JSON-RPC API requests to various Ethereum public networks.

This tool is useful for early prototype and hackathons - allowing you to quickly test out API calls without having to do any sort of configuration.

This project contains Typescript and React code.  We also use [https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html) for state management.

We use [https://material-ui.com/](https://material-ui.com/) for UI components.

## Setup
To run:

* `npm install`
* `npm run dev`
* Open `localhost:3330` in a browser.
